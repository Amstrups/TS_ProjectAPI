# API/Backend for TechSkunk(TS)-Project

## Important information

Due to this project only being used as a sample of abilities, I have included a '.env'-file in this reposotory. Please refrain from sharing these sensitive information with people, who it does not concern.

## Requirements

You will need to have installed the official 'Node'-image locally to your desktop for this application to build/run.

You can see the documentation here [https://hub.docker.com/_/node], or simply use the following command:
